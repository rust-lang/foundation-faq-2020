# Rust Foundation 2020 Q&A

⭐️ [**Read the summary of questions and answers so far in our FAQ!**][faq] ⭐️

After this summer's ["Laying the foundation for Rust's future"][aug-blog] blog
post the [Rust Foundation Project Group] began the work to setup a new home for
the Rust Project. We're getting near the end of the work, and we'd love to
answer all the questions you have on the Rust Foundation!

We welcome everyone to post their questions as [new issues][new], and the team
will do their best to answer them! You can also check [the open issues][issues]
to see what other people asked and the answers to their questions. If you can't
open GitHub issues or want to send questions privately you can send them via
email to <foundation@rust-lang.org>.

Please note that if an issue is labelled [`answered`] the team will not return
to it, so if you have a follow up quesiton, please post it as a new issue.

## FAQ

Periodically, we'll be summarizing the set of questions and answers on the 
issue tracker and collecting them in an [FAQ](faq). 

## Maintainer Q&A

The members of the [Rust Core Team] will answer questions from the members of the
Rust Team starting from December 2nd.

## Community Q&A Sessions

The members of the [Rust Core Team] will answer questions from the members of the
community during the following time periods:

|                                                 | PST US | EST US | UTC Europe/Africa  | India                   | China            |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Dec 7th ([View in my timezone][dec7-session])   | 3-6pm  | 6-9pm  | 23:00-2:00         | 4:30am-7:30am (Dec 8)   | 7am-10am (Dec 8) |
| Dec 9th ([View in my timezone][dec9-session])   | 4-7am  | 7-10am | 12:00-15:00        | 5:30-8:30pm             | 8pm-11pm         |

Starting on Dec 7th, this repo will be publicly readable, and will open for
community members to open issues during the sessions.

## Live Broadcasts

In addition to this repository, we’ve scheduled two “live broadcasts”.
These sessions will feature members of the core team discussing and responding
to some of the questions that have been asked thus far. Naturally, even if you
can’t catch the live broadcast, the video will be available for streaming
afterwards. 

|                                                   | PST US | EST US | UTC Europe/Africa  | India                   | China            |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Dec 9th ([View in my timezone][dec9-broadcast])   | 3-4pm  | 6-7pm  | 23:00-24:00        | 4:30-5:30am   (Dec 10)  | 7-8am   (Dec 10) |
| Dec 12th ([View in my timezone][dec11-broadcast]) | 4-5am  | 7-8am  | 12:00-13:00        | 5:30pm-6:30pm           | 8-9pm            |

### Things to keep in mind

Please keep in mind that the Foundation is still in its final stages of being
set up. This means that we are not able to talk about sponsors or specific
details of legal documents at this time. 

Additionally: none of the members of the [Rust Core Team] are lawyers, but we
have been working closely with lawyers. Many questions may end up touching on
legal issues; the [Rust Core Team] will do its best to communicate its
understanding, but we'd like to keep disputes of the law out of this forum to
the extent that we can!
